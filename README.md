## Personal Considerations
I've tried to follow and maintain the figma design the most while making the project as responsive as possible.

The final version of the application was deployed to vercel and can be found [here](https://coderockr-challenge.vercel.app/)


## Stack used

- [NextJS (CNA)](https://nextjs.org/)

I've chosen NextJS for it's ecosystem and built-in TypeScrpit support.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

I've been using typescript on all my projects and with no surprise I've used on this one too. Making the code easier to debug and more readable.


- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

I've used style-components on a previous project and decided to use again for it's ability to build custom components with css.


- [styled-normalize](https://github.com/sergeysova/styled-normalize)

To normalize the css of my application across different browsers.


- [react-infinite-scroll-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component)

It was my first time working with a infite scroll design so I used this package to help me.
